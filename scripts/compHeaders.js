      "Prefer Kokkoro tankless swap comp - Kaori + Makoto + Hiyori + Kokkoro + Mitsuki. Can replace Hiyori with other DPS. Comp is mostly auto, except you will need to manually tank swap Kokkoro as soon as you are able to. Comp is heavily affected by RNG; if Kaori dies, you will do ~700k damage. If Kaori lives and you opt to manual you can do 900k+. Mage comp is also good damage here. However, mages are preferred on B3 and B5, so only use mages on B1 if you are unable to use them on B3 or B5."
